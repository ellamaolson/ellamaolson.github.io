I worked closely with major customers to devise a list of pain points they were experiencing in this migration process and built a migration tool to scan, parse, and recommend how to migrate their applications.",
        "ngMigration-Assistant is an analysis tool that recommends a custom migration path to take to Angular. It scans an AngularJS application for AngularJS patterns, provides statistics on your application, and identify the necessary steps for migrating to Angular. It highlights files containing AngularJS patterns and directs on how to convert those patterns to be Angular compatible. It is the first step in starting a your migration from AngularJS to Angular.",
        "In the process, I shared this tool and my learnings with the larger Angular community - speaking at local and international meetups and conferences and wrote a detailed blog announcing the tool.",
        "We created a community hub, ngMigration Forum, for discussing, learning, and sharing relevant information on migrating. So many businesses were going through the same experience and creating private internal documentation I saw duplicated across many teams, so a centralized place felt necessary."
